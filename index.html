      <p class= "simple"> üíñ Kia ora e hoa mƒÅ! Welcome to my blog for my dev journey at EDA.  üíñ 
        <br> <br>
        My GitHub username is courtney-brown-dev-journey. We were told to use our full names, but as mine is a common English name that's why I have dev journey next to it. This actually ties in quite nicely to my blog!  
        <br> <br>
        Here you'll see my learnings from the five weeks of foundations on the build up to bootcamp in 2022. You'll see my journey from going to practically knowing nothing about coding to knowing a bunch of different stuff.
        <br> <br>
        I am from Te Awakairangi, Lower Hutt and have lived in Te Whanganui-a-Tara for the last 7 years! I have a Masters in scriptwriting and a BA in theatre and English literature. So it's fair to say this is a bit different to what I'm normally doing! Recently I had my first short 'The Girls' play as part of WhƒÅnau MƒÅrama, the New Zealand International Film Festival. I enjoy setting up nice little spots in my apartment that I live in with my partner, as you can see I love a good candle set up and a cup of tea. My lovely friend drew the cartoon picture of me below!

        This blog isn't meant to be a work of art, but more of an archive. I know she's cute, and not perfect. But it's not about making something amazing, it's about making something and what you learn on the way. <br>
