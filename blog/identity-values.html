        <h1 class="intro"> ✨ Courtney's Dev Journey ✨</h1>  

<h1 class="title"> Identity & Values ✌️</h1>  

<p class="total">I've worked on a range of theatre productions and you can get some real characters. Often because the work is unpaid or on a low wage, deadlines and accountability can slip. As someone leading the project this can be really frustrating, especially when you feel like you have to hold the whole team together and keep driving things. So I've worked with people who haven't delivered on time, communicated that they're unable to deliver on time and not respond to messages. I have asked for them to acknowledge that they've received my message, and to reply to a 'yes or no' question if they're able to continue in the role. It took a few instances of this happening to realise this is an easier approach, especially for those who struggle with their mental wellbeing. I've also tried to remove pressure by saying I can do x and x but I need to know if you've done x so I know if I can do it. I think offering a lifeline and trying to remove the stress of them having to verbalise what they haven't been able to do ultimately shifts things along faster rather than asking how things are tracking. Because of this I often will say I don't need an excuse or a reason on why you haven't done something, I just need to know if it has been done or not so it can be. <br>

<br>Theatre is a bit different, but I would probably use a similar approach with other work if the person was being avoidant. I'm not sure what would be a better strategy, as this one although will often lead to more work, will reduce stress for myself and them. But I think everytime something like this happens, it's best to 'give an out' earlier rather than waiting and then hopefully that develops into a clearer level of communication down the track. <br>

<br> I don't think of things in terms of ethics. So my example for this one is a situation that made people feel uncomfortable, and then I had to make things feel more uncomfortable so things could be addressed. Someone new at work made an inappropriate comment about a senior staff member in front of everyone, which really upset her. She didn't feel comfortable addressing it, so I got her permission and let him know that what he said wasn't okay, how it impacted her and that she'd like an apology. This was awkward because I didn't really know him and I could tell he was trying to fit in but missed the mark. But because of doing this, he did apologise and made active changes with his remarks. I made the call to do this, as I knew it would continue to upset her, and it had the potential for others to think this behaviour was okay. I approached the situation head on, but made sure to not 'blame' but educate with warmth and kindess, so that it would be taken on board, rather than dismissed. <br> </p>

<h2 class="heading"> Strengths </h2>
<p class="total">My main strengths are that I'm passionate, creative, principled, and altruistic. These all flow together really nicely when I have projects and a motivation to get something done. I think I will need to really lean on my passionate and principled side to keep going when things get tough, as they already are! I think having a good structure will help a lot with road blocks and my enthusiasm hopefully will limit my frustration of being stuck. </p>

<h2 class="heading"> Values </h2>

<p class="total"> <strong> Honesty </strong>is a big value for me. As I've gotten older I've been able to clarify more about why honesty holds importance for me and what I think honesty is. It's easy to think it's just not lying. But I think when I come to the table, I've been honest to myself, and then honest to whoever. If someone is being what they think is honest to me and not to themselves, it doesn't feel honest to me. I've realised I expect a great deal of introspection on the other person's end, as that is extremely natural for me. I don't expect a level of perfection, but I do like to know that people are working on themselves, and being honest and open. I like to know what I see is what I get, I don't like the idea of being 'deceived'. <br>

<br> <strong> Communication </strong> is another key value for me which also ties in to honesty. I need to know where things are at, and to be left in the dark, or to feel like I've been left in the dark is something that I struggle with. I don't need to know everything, just that similar things are being considered. <br>

<br> Care and consideration of others and self are big values for me. I'm not too sure what I could use as an umbrella term for this in English. However, I think <strong>manaakitanga </strong> covers this. The definition of manaakitanga is hospitality, kindness, generosity, support - the process of showing respect, generosity and care for others. It took me a while to realise that this was a value, as I saw it as a default. I just expected everyone to have manaakitanga in mind and to me this is really key for any sort of relationship or interaction. <br>

<br> I also really value <strong>creativity and self expression </strong>. Art, creativity, any form of expression are key things to me that show humanity. Creativity is good for the soul and the heart, and is a way to connect with and to others in a unique way. <br>

<br> <strong>Enthusiasm</strong> sounds like a strange value, but recently I've been able to identify that it is a key value for me. I like to see people, happy and passionate about something just like I like to be passionate and happy about something. It can be a bit tricky to balance, as often I want people to match my level of enthusiasm. So when they don't it can be a bit of a slippery slope for me. So because I value enthusiasm, it's also a focus of mine, to make sure I can maintain my enthusiasm and passion, without letting outside influence dampen it. <br>

<br> I did the Myers Brigss test and got Advocate INFJ-T. <br>

<br> <em>“Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.” <br>
JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE </em> <br>

<br> Advocates are the rarest personality type of them all. Advocates want to find meaning in their work and to know that they are helping and connecting with people.	This is a feature of my personality that I find very challenging. Finding meaning in work is so subjective, and there are days I'm able to find meaning in my mahi, and other days when I can't. In order to stay present, I actively need to find and maintain a sense of meaning or purpose to keep going. It also says that advocates crave opportunities to learn, which I feel is apt as I hate the idea of not growing. Whether it be learning a new skill, program or something about myself, this is the core of my focus. Sometimes, feeling like I'm not going anywhere, or things feel too slow, is really challenging for me. This is something I really identified a few years ago, so last year, I actually tried really hard to have slow periods. Since I like to learn and operate at a fast speed, this is so hard for me. Knowing that this was something I ought to work on because I can't always be operating at a fast pace with lots of things on the go. I focused on relaxing and being okay with stillness (still a work in progress) to help feel more comfortable when I'm not constantly on the go. Speed is still a priority to me, but my expectations of others to match my pace has altered to become more reasonable. <br>

<h2 class="heading">Strengths and limitations </h2>
<p class="total">I feel like I'm quite aware of myself and what I can do. But I don't like the idea of looking at something as a weakness, I prefer to see it a place I can grow. I guess technically that's the same thing, but 'weakness' gives off an air of defeat. And as I'm someone who likes to grow and challenge myself, I like to see weaknesses as something I can tackle head on. <br>

<br>I know that I'm prone to burning out, getting frustrated quickly, being hard on myself and criticism. If criticism isn't given prompted, or isn't constructive, I find it hard to process, because what's the point? Criticism/feedback, should be given for growth, rather than an attack. Sometimes it can be hard for me to differentiate the two. <br>

<br>Over the last few years I have been focusing and reworking my time and energy to avoid/limit burn out. This I think will always be a work in progress, but the first step is to be aware of it, then plan. <br>

<br>In a working environment, I like to have check ins to see where people are at emotionally and physically, as well as where they're feeling confident and less confident. This is a great way to avoid awkwardness and stress, as you're starting off on the same page. I think I have to be careful with toeing the line of discipline and burn out. A way to limit the chance of burn out would be making time for myself where I can do things that I enjoy like reading, roller skating and seeing shows. I think I need to continue making a clear foundation time and a clear relax time in my weeks. <br>
