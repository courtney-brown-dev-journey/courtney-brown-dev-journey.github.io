    <h1> Learning Plan</h1>
    <body>
        <h1> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h1>
<p>My long term goal is to find mahi that I believe is meaningful and has purpose. This is pretty vague, I know but that is the core of the role that I want to find. A long term goal I have is to keep learning and to keep challenging myself. I would love to work somewhere where I can continue to grow in my skillset and myself, and I think that will lie somewhere within UX and development. I recently ended a secondment for a UX role and found it exciting to be part of something that could then role out changes, I think development would feel closer to being a part of making change happen. </p>

<h1> A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning </h1>
<p> My main strengths are that I'm passionate, creative, principled, and altruistic. These all flow together really nicely when I have projects and a motivation to get something done. I think I will need to really lean on my passionate and principled side to keep going when things get tough, as they already are! I think having a good structure will help a lot with road blocks and my enthusiasm hopefully will limit my frustration of being stuck. </p>

<p> My main limitation is that I can act too fast and slightly alter something that needs to be more or less set in stone. This is something I'm aware of and have been trying to actively slow down for. With this I have been making it a priority to do one yoga class a week, and short yoga at home sessions before sitting down and studying to help slow my mind. I have plans to weave mindfulness in a bit more, but as that's something that I struggle with yoga is my first step. I also can get frustrated relatively easily so I'm practicing extending the fuse so it's easier to go with the flow </p>

<h1> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h1>
<p>I would like my abilities to learn and teach/guide to grow alongside each other. I think this will really kick in around bootcamp when hopefully we can have more face to face time. I'd also like to develop my patience, attention span and belief in myself. </p>

<h1> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. </h1>

<p> I am committed to be open and honest about my experiences and where my energy and wellbeing levels are at. Below Iâ€™ve detailed the ways that I will cope with stress. </p>

<h1> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you </h1>
<p> As I knew this would be something brand new and it could quite easily be something that stresses me out, I've built in a midday gym routine to make sure I get out of the house and I'm active. Throughout the year I've also been taking note of four main things: socialising, exercise, mindfulness/health and creative practice/involvement. This has been a great way to keep track of when it's been a minute since I've done something health or wellbeing related e.g. counselling and I should look at scheduling a session in, so I do feel prepared if things do get tough.  </p>

<p> I've also figured out that if I'm working from home mainly, I need at least four solid friend hangs through out the week, but if I'm working with people everyday two to three is fine. (This doesn't include spending time with my partner.) I've also realised that I need to do exercise at least three times a week to help with  my mood, so I'm aiming for 4-5 gym sessions a week while studying. And then I try to do a minimum of two things a month that are tied to the arts e.g. see a theatre show or a movie.  </p>

<p> That's a bit of background on how I've been building my plans for when things get overwhelming so I can identify what was lacking in that week and how I can rebuild the next week. I also have been making clear 'study' and clear 'down/free' time to help free present while doing both. I also am making a sloth rug, have a new puzzle ready to go, a new book and masks to make when I feel like I need a craft mindful time. </p>

<h1> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h1>
<p> As someone who has had  quite poor mental health in the past, I do try to address things head on so I don't spiral. I have a few free sessions left from work and money put aside to go to counselling if I feel like things might spiral. I don't have too much pride around asking for help, and have a strong support system within my friends and my partner. But if I need tech help, I'm not afraid to post in Slack, hit up my facilitator and hit up my friend who recently graduated from the course.  </p>

<h1> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team </h1>
<p> At the moment, I think just technical support when needed. I do like weekly check ins, especially working remotely as it feels less isolated.  </p>
