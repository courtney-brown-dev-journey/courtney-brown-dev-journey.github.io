        <h2 class="title"> Problem Solving üßê </h2>
<p class="total"><strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:<br> </strong>
    <br><em>-Got blocked on a simple problem<br>
-Solved a problem in an elegant way. </em> <br><br>
<strong>In both cases:<br> </strong>
<br>-What was the problem?  <br>
<em>-What problem solving techniques did you use?  <br>
-How did you feel throughout the process? <br>
-What did you learn? </em><br> 

<br>
    At the beginning of foundations, I had included my Desktop into a part of the course that wasn‚Äôt meant to be there. This happened because I rushed and didn‚Äôt read through the instructions properly, or think through my actions before doing them. I asked for help from a friend, and did some Googling to get it sorted. But before asking for help, I sort of just did the same thing over and over, thinking maybe the next time it would fix it even though I didn‚Äôt change anything! <br>

<br>When doing a new exercise that was about a brand new concept, I initially panicked - thinking, how could I do this? Then took a breath, and read line by line and applied the Rubber Ducky Method. This made me realise it was a lot simpler than I thought it was and I worked through it really quickly through breaking it into small tasks, rather than thinking of the bigger picture.<br>

<br>Both times, I really learnt that I need to breathe, slow down and read the situation before jumping into action or making assumptions.<br> </p>

<br><p class= "total"><strong> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong><br> 
<br> <strong>Pseudocode </strong>
I feel good about giving this a go, I don‚Äôt think I quite know enough to really utilize this method yet. But it does make you break down and really think about what you actually have to do. <br>

<br><strong>Trying something </strong>
I think sometimes I can get a little too trigger happy with trying something, but I guess it's a good thing not to be too tentitive!  <br>
 
<br> <strong>Rubber ducky method </strong>
I think this one is currently my favourite one, as it really makes you think about why you‚Äôve done something, or what the instructions are really asking you to do. It‚Äôs also a good way to proof-read, as when I‚Äôm doing the Rubber ducky method, it‚Äôs almost like giving myself a fresh point of view. <br>

<br> <strong> Reading error messages </strong>
I feel pretty good about doing this, as it shows you were to look and what to focus on fixing. <br>
 
<br> <br> <strong>Console.logging </strong>
It‚Äôs a good way to check that you‚Äôre actually doing what you think you‚Äôre doing. <br>
 
<br> <strong>Googling </strong>
This can be kind of hit or miss, so I think I‚Äôve gotten better at Googling, and trying to figure out what‚Äôs going to help me understand something. <br>
 
<br> <strong>Asking your peers for help </strong>
I have no problem asking for help from others, I just worry sometimes about being a bit annoying or about their availability. <br>
 
<br> <strong>Asking coaches for help </strong>
This is similar to asking peers for help, I‚Äôd prefer to go to peers first just because they‚Äôre more likely to be free and it‚Äôs a good way to connect to people who are doing the course. <br>
 
<br> <strong>Improving your process with reflection </strong>
I think this one will be ongoing. But I do feel relatively intune with myself and I think reflection makes it easy to shape your days and weeks as you become more aware of how you learn.<br> </p>
