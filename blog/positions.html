<h1 class="title"> What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1>
<p class="position">
    Why thank you for asking. First off, what do these all mean? Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are options under the position property. Position property is where you can manipulate the location of an element on a page. There are five position properties: static, relative, fixed, absolute and sticky. Today I’ll just be going into detail about three: relative, fixed and absolute.
    </p>

<body> 
    <div>
<h2 class="heading">
    Positioning  
</h2>
<p class="position">
    A web page is made out of blocks of pixels and relative, absolute and fixed positioning are ways to present the blocks (elements). Positioning means that you’re able to override the normal flow of a document. 
</p> 
</div>
<div class>
    <h2  class="heading"> Relative </h2>
    <p class="position"> Relative is often used as a connection to something or someone else. Here it means, relative to itself. This one's a bit confusing but essentially it means that it allows objects to be placed in relation to one another. You can move elements left, right, top and bottom by specifying the amount of pixels you’d like it to move. So if you wanted to move the box to the left and the bottom, it would shift the amount specified, but would leave a gap of where it had been. This makes something like a trail.  </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 class="heading"> Absolute </h2>
    <p class="position"> Whereas absolute will not leave a gap of where the block has been it just moves the block to where it had been specified. Absolute is where you can place any element wherever you want. An absolute element has no effect on other elements, and no other elements affect it. An absolute element will travel down the page with you when you scroll and can overlap other elements. It also means that any child elements will respond to the size of the page rather than the parent.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 class="heading"> Fixed </h2>
    <p class="position"> 
    This one you’re all probably more aware of. It’s where it stays on the screen in a specified spot when you scroll. You’ll often see this with ads, and key things like the search bar on a website. Sometimes it can overlap other content which doesn’t make it as accessible.
